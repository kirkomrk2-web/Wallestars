## Security Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Keep `config.py` private (it's gitignored)
- Use environment variables in shared environments
- Regularly rotate your API tokens

❌ **DON'T:**
- Commit `config.py` to version control
- Share your `config.py` file
- Use production credentials in test environments
