## Features

- 🔐 Secure authentication with n8n instance
- 📋 Lists all workflows with their current status (Active/Inactive)
- ⏱️ Shows last execution status and timestamp for each workflow
- 📊 Provides summary statistics (total workflows, active/inactive counts)
- ✨ Color-coded output with emoji indicators for easy readability

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply run the script:

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed

If you see an authentication error:
1. Verify your email and password are correct
2. Check that your n8n instance URL is correct and accessible
3. Ensure your user account has the necessary permissions

### Connection Errors

If you see connection errors:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the n8n instance is running and accessible
3. Check if there are any firewall rules blocking the connection

### No Workflows Found

If no workflows are displayed:
1. Verify workflows exist in your n8n instance
2. Check that your user has permissions to view workflows

## Security Note

⚠️ **Important**: This script contains hardcoded credentials. For production use, consider:
- Using environment variables for credentials
- Implementing a secure credential storage solution
- Using API keys instead of username/password authentication

Example with environment variables:
```python
import os

N8N_URL = os.getenv('N8N_URL', 'https://n8n.srv1201204.hstgr.cloud')
N8N_EMAIL = os.getenv('N8N_EMAIL')
N8N_PASSWORD = os.getenv('N8N_PASSWORD')
```

Then run:
```bash
export N8N_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
export N8N_PASSWORD="your-password"
python3 check_n8n_workflows.py
```
