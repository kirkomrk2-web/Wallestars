  # NOTE: --legacy-peer-deps is required due to peer dependency conflicts between
  # some devDependencies (e.g., @vitejs/plugin-react and react versions).
  # This flag allows the build to proceed despite these conflicts.
  #
  # REVIEW COMPLETED (2026-01-10):
  # - React versions are compatible (all packages use React 18.3.1)
  # - No actual peer dependency conflicts detected with current versions
  # - Flag may be vestigial from earlier configuration
  # - Security note: esbuild <=0.24.2 has moderate vulnerability (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)
  #   Fix requires upgrading to Vite 7.x (breaking change)
  #
  # RECOMMENDATION: Try removing --legacy-peer-deps flag in next deployment.
  # If build succeeds, it can be permanently removed. Otherwise, keep for stability.
